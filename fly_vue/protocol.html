<div class="main">
    Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away.
    And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall
    there with a sign.O Troupe of little vagrants of the world,
    leave your footprints in my words.The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover.
    It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal.What language is thine, O sea?
    The language of eternal question.
    What language is thy answer, O sky?
    The language of eternal silence
    We, the rustling leaves, have a voice that answers the storms,
    but who are you so silent?"
    I am a mere flower.
